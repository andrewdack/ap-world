              During World War I, propaganda reshaped women's roles in society
              by encouraging their shift from domestic duties to active
              participation in the workforce, filling jobs left by enlisted men.
              However, it also reinforced traditional gender roles by framing
              women's work as an extension of their duties at home.

            <h3>Historical Context</h3>
            <p>
              World War I (1914-1918) was a global conflict sparked by the
              assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Tensions between major
              imperialist powers, fueled by nationalism, militarism, imperial
              competition, and a flawed alliance system turned the crisis into a
              full-scale war. <br /><br />

              The Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottomans) fought
              against the Allied Powers (France, Britain, Russia, U.S.)

              <br /><br />Trench warfare on the Western Front led to a deadly
              stalemate. New weapons like machine guns, tanks, and poison gas
              increased carnage and devastation.

              <br /><br />The war ended with the defeat of the Central Powers.

              <p>
                Not only were men targeted for enlistment but also indirectly
                redefined women's roles in society. By portraying a woman as
                eager to serve, the poster challenges the traditional domestic
                image of women and positions them as active participants in the
                war effort. This messaging normalized the idea that women should
                contribute outside the home, reinforcing the broader societal
                shift toward female employment in traditionally male-dominated
                sectors. While the primary goal of the poster is to recruit men,
                it also increases the visibility and value of women in public
                life, supporting the idea that propaganda played a crucial role
                in transforming women's societal roles during World War I.

              <p>
                uses a direct and emotional appeal to encourage men to enlist in
                World War I. By presenting women as strong supporters of the war
                effort, the poster frames enlistment as a patriotic duty, urging
                men to fight for their country and loved ones. The message
                conveys a sense of moral obligation, suggesting that failing to
                enlist would be a betrayal not just of the nation but of women
                at home. It reflects the era's complex gender dynamics, with
                women taking on new public roles while still being depicted as
                primarily supportive figures within the home front.
