              During World War I, propaganda reshaped women's roles in society
              by encouraging their shift from domestic duties to active
              participation in the workforce, filling jobs left by enlisted men.
              However, it also reinforced traditional gender roles by framing
              women's work as an extension of their duties at home.

            <h3>Historical Context</h3>
            <p>
              World War I (1914-1918) was a global conflict sparked by the
              assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Tensions between major
              imperialist powers, fueled by nationalism, militarism, imperial
              competition, and a flawed alliance system turned the crisis into a
              full-scale war. <br /><br />

              The Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottomans) fought
              against the Allied Powers (France, Britain, Russia, U.S.)

              <br /><br />Trench warfare on the Western Front led to a deadly
              stalemate. New weapons like machine guns, tanks, and poison gas
              increased carnage and devastation.

              <br /><br />The war ended with the defeat of the Central Powers.

              <p>
                Not only were men targeted for enlistment but also indirectly
                redefined women's roles in society. By portraying a woman as
                eager to serve, the poster challenges the traditional domestic
                image of women and positions them as active participants in the
                war effort. This messaging normalized the idea that women should
                contribute outside the home, reinforcing the broader societal
                shift toward female employment in traditionally male-dominated
                sectors. While the primary goal of the poster is to recruit men,
                it also increases the visibility and value of women in public
                life, supporting the idea that propaganda played a crucial role
                in transforming women's societal roles during World War I.

                Uses a direct and emotional appeal to encourage men to enlist in
                World War I. By presenting women as strong supporters of the war
                effort, the poster frames enlistment as a patriotic duty, urging
                men to fight for their country and loved ones. The message
                conveys a sense of moral obligation, suggesting that failing to
                enlist would be a betrayal not just of the nation but of women
                at home. It reflects the era's complex gender dynamics, with
                women taking on new public roles while still being depicted as
                primarily supportive figures within the home front.

              <p>
                While unable to enlist in the military during WWI, some women
                were admitted into the war effort near the end of the First
                World War, either as military nurses or other support staff.
                This poster, featuring President Woodrow Wilson's quote and the
                American flag vibrantly illustrated, emphasizes the importance
                of women's contributions to the war effort, framing their work
                as essential to the nation's success. This poster highlights
                women's growing roles in the military from the 20th to 21st
                century. Although not initially in combat, women gained more
                opportunities over time. It emphasizes that women's work was as
                valuable as men's, helping break traditional gender roles and
                advance gender equality, especially in fields like medicine.

              <h4>1918, United States of America</h4>
              <p>
                This iconic poster campaign, launched by the United States
                government during World War I, directly linked women's
                industrial labor to military success. The message "For Every
                Fighter a Woman Worker" created a powerful parallel between
                soldiers on the front lines and women in factories, emphasizing
                their equal importance to the war effort. This propaganda
                revolutionized perceptions by acknowledging women's vital role
                in wartime production, legitimizing their place in
                male-dominated industries. Though many returned to domestic life
                post-war, it set a precedent for women's expanded workforce
                participation and economic empowerment.

                This Liberty Bonds poster represents a crucial aspect of women's
                wartime contributions: financial support. The poster encouraged
                women to invest in war bonds, effectively making them active
                participants in funding the war effort. This type of propaganda
                was significant as it recognized women's economic power and
                their ability to contribute to the war effort through financial
                means. The messaging helped establish women as important
                economic actors in society, challenging traditional norms that
                limited women's roles to domestic and caregiving duties.

                This British propaganda poster directly addresses women's role
                in the war industry, specifically in munitions production. The
                war had not only increased the need for women to take up male
                roles, but also the country's dependence on industrial
                productivity. It represents a significant shift in societal
                attitudes as it openly encourages women to take on industrial
                work traditionally reserved for men. The poster highlights
                women's vital role in wartime manufacturing, showing how
                propaganda helped normalize their presence in industry and break
                down gender barriers.

            <h3>Social Impact</h3>
            <p>
              As men went to fight, women stepped into roles traditionally held
              by men, whether that was working in factories, driving ambulances,
              or serving as nurses. This showed that women could handle
              demanding jobs, helping to challenge previous gender stereotypes
              that they were confined to domestic and caregiving roles. After
              the war, this shift led to more support for women's rights,
              including the right to vote in several countries, like the United
              States and Great Britain. While many women were pushed back into
              traditional roles after the war ended, their contributions during
              WWI led to long-term change in women's social and political
              status.

            <p>
              With millions of men fighting, women entered the workforce in
              large numbers to fill jobs in factories, offices, and farms. They
              produced weapons, built machinery, and kept the economy and war
              effort running. Their economic contributions proved that women
              could succeed in paid labor and helped lay the foundation for
              greater female workforce participation in the future.
